# MLP

* An implementation of two layer fully connected neural network using backpropagation for classification problem from scratch. 
* Compute gradient using the chain rule.
* Use  cross entropy as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent to train the model parameters.
* The implementation is inspired by logistic regression and softmax regression.
